fluenium

No it's not a matter that I'm sick. OK, I'm sick about testing software I ever done.

Because I love the Ento To End testing verry much, and I'd like to utilise it in the UI project, I started to develop test using Selenium.
But to be honest the selenium API... is not what I like, and more over is not what I'd like to learn developers who should know to much about the Java programming.
I also gived a try with Protractor e2e testing, but because I'm not a JS developer I'm not feeling confortable with languages without type checking. Maybe soon I will enjoy tools like Typescript, but since this time I'd like to use my favourite Java languages and define automatic tests for the web UI.

So here's comes the idea, why I can not write my tests that way, so even my non-verry technical friend will be able to read it. And then I realised, that I'm creating a new wrapper for the Selenium testsframework, which simply makes the syntaxt so nice that even Edgar Alan Poe can write tests using it! So here you go, the Fluent Seleniu, so called fluenium.

Hope you will enjoy it, and join the project so together we will implement a new brilant language for test development.

Hence this project is extremally new, and needs in my oppinion a lot of attention, please do not hesitate to fork it, and extend it in any way you wish.
